\section{Notes}

\subsection{Choice of inheritance pattern}

\begin{comment}
InheritanceType: JOINED; Common table for base type, additional infos stored 
separately. SINGLE_TABLE sounds nice for our needs, but support is optional.

MappedSuperclass: the superclass contains persisted information, but is not
mapped as an entity by the JPA provider. State & mapping information common to
multiple entity classes. Non-entity superclasses don't support persistence,
and abstract entities are mapped (which we don't need).
\end{comment}

\subsection{Date aggregation in JPQL}

\begin{comment}
JPQL does not support date aggregation in any reasonable form, which means we
can't do summation within the query. Extract all rows individually, then
create the sum within java code.
\end{comment}

\subsection{Indices, pros and cons}

\begin{comment}
When is the User.password index helpful, when could it be harmful. Optional:
large-scale tests.
