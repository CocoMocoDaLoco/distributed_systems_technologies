\subsection{Choice of inheritance pattern}

\begin{comment}
InheritanceType: JOINED; Common table for base type, additional infos stored 
separately. SINGLE_TABLE sounds nice for our needs, but support is optional.

MappedSuperclass: the superclass contains persisted information, but is not
mapped as an entity by the JPA provider. State & mapping information common to
multiple entity classes. Non-entity superclasses don't support persistence,
and abstract entities are mapped (which we don't need).
