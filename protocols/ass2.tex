\section{Theory}

\subsection{EJB Lifecycles (1 Point)}

\emph{
Explain the lifecycle of each bean type defined in the EJB 3.1 specification. What optimizations can the
EJB container perform for the respective type? Also think about typical use cases the respective bean
type provides to the developer.}

\subsection{Dependency Injection (2 Points)}

\emph{
Explain the way dependency injection is performed by the EJB container. What kind of resources may
be injected into a bean, and what are the different annotations that can be used?}

\subsection{Java Transaction API (2 Points)}

\emph{
The EJB architecture provides a mechanism for distributed transactions. Explain the two ways how
transactions can be defined. How is the concept of distributed transactions accomplished behind the
scenes, i.e. what tasks have to be performed by the EJB container?}

\subsection{Remoting Technologies (1 Point)}

\emph{Compare EJB remoting and Web services. When would you use one technology, and when the other? Is
one of them strictly superior? How do these technologies relate to other remoting technologies that you
might know from other lectures (for instance, Java RMI, CORBA, or even socket programming)?}
